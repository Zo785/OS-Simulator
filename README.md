🖥️ Operating System Simulator
A terminal-based Operating System Simulator developed in C++ for educational purposes. This project demonstrates core OS concepts including process management, multitasking, memory allocation, user/kernel mode operations, and inter-process communication using shared memory.

🚀 Features 🎯 User & Kernel Mode Interface User mode for general tasks Kernel mode for managing system-level operations (add/delete tasks) 🧠 Multitasking and Process Creation Each task launches as a separate process in a new terminal using gnome-terminal + exec 💾 Resource Management RAM, hard disk, and core values provided by user at startup Shared memory used for centralized resource tracking 🕒 Task Scheduling FCFS Scheduling implemente Semaphore-based mutual exclusion for critical sections 🧮 Built-in Tasks & Utilities Calculator (with semaphores) Stopwatch (multithreaded with atomic control) Calendar and real-time clock Expense tracker File operations (Copy, Delete) Tic-Tac-Toe Game Background music playback Launch external browser (Google Chrome)

🔐 Kernel Mode Access To access Kernel mode: Select “Kernel Mode” during login Password: admin Features: Add/Delete Tasks View All System Tasks

Concepts Demonstrated ✅ Multitasking ✅ Threads ✅ Shared Memory ✅ Process Creation ✅ EXEC-like Commands ✅ Resource Allocation ✅ Semaphore-based Scheduling ✅ User vs Kernel Mode
